A small language model.

## Status
I'm currently working on training base model to run on limited resources using the CoQA dataset.

## Todo
- [ ] Enhance TensorBoard visualizations
  - [ ] Text Samples after each epoch of training
  - [ ] Model graph
  - [ ] Histograms of weights and biases
  - [ ] embedding projector
  - [ ] attention visualization
  - [ ] activation maps
- [ ] Export config (hyperparameters, temp) into separate config.json
- [ ] Improve modularity of code
